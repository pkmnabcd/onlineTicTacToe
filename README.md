This is a personal project of mine that is based on a python tic tac toe game made by @erikfalor.

I have translated it to C++, and will be using this project to help me learn how to use unix socket/network programming by making a server and client to add online multiplayer to the basic game.

Right now, you can play the tic tac toe game by yourself by building the project and running the `Client` program. I'm working on the server architecture first and I'll later add the online functionality to the client.
