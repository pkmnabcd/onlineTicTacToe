General Design:
Server has a list of people who are connected (with names that someone can use to connect to someone else instead of an ip address)
Server also has the gamestate of each game it's surveying.

Two clients connect to the server, and can put in a name. If two people are connected and type each others name, then they are put in a match together.
    Things the server needs to keep track of:
        Board state, whose turn it is
    Assume no cheating, so the board state comes from whoever's turn it is
